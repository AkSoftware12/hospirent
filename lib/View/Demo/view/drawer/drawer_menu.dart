By renting products through our platform, you agree to the following conditions, including a strict non-refundable policy for all payments: 1. All rental payments, including fees and deposits, are non-refundable unless otherwise stated in writing by us. 2. You must provide valid identification (e.g., Aadhaar, passport, or driverâ€™s license) at the time of booking, which will be verified before product delivery. 3. A refundable security deposit is required, which will be returned within 7-10 business days after the rental period, subject to a quality check confirming no damage to the product. 4. You are responsible for returning the Rental Product in the same condition as received, excluding normal wear and tear; any damage will result in deduction from the security deposit. 5. The minimum rental period is three months, and early termination does not entitle you to a refund of rental fees. 6. You must not sublet, transfer, or allow unauthorized use of the Rental Product by third parties. 7. Products must be used only for their intended purpose and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. 8. Late returns will incur a penalty fee of 10% of the daily rental rate per day, deducted from the security deposit. 9. You are responsible for any additional costs, such as cleaning fees (minimum INR 200) if the product is returned in poor condition, or repair costs for damages caused by misuse. 10. We reserve the right to cancel your rental booking if you fail to meet eligibility requirements (e.g., valid ID, payment, or credit check), with no refund of any prepaid amounts. 11. Delivery and pickup of Rental Products are subject to availability and may incur additional fees if your location lacks elevator access or requires special handling. 12. You must notify us at least 48 hours in advance for any changes to the rental agreement, such as extending the rental period; failure to do so may result in additional charges or forfeiture of the rental. These terms ensure a fair and efficient rental process for all users."
